[Your Name]'s GitHub



Welcome aboard! Just a guy from Zambia, coding with grit and gaming with soul. FC Gamer by night, software craftsman by day. This is my professional GitHub—where code meets creativity and problems get smoked.

What’s Cooking?

Projects that hit hard and work harder. From Zambia-inspired builds to gaming-fueled experiments, I’m all about clean code and big impact.
