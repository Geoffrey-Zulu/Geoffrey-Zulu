Welcome aboard! Just a guy from Zambia, coding with grit and gaming with soul. FC Gamer by night, software craftsman by day. This is my professional GitHubâ€”where code meets creativity and problems get smoked.

Whatâ€™s Cooking?

Projects that hit hard and work harder. From Zambia-inspired builds to gaming-fueled experiments, Iâ€™m all about clean code and big impact.
